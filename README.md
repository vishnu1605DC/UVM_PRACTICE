# 🛠️ UVM Practice Testbenches

Welcome! This repository contains a series of **practice testbenches** to learn and explore different concepts of **UVM (Universal Verification Methodology)**. Each practice builds on the **same base components** but experiments with different **TLM connections** and communication techniques. 🚀

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into numbered practice folders:

practice_1/
practice_2/
practice_3/
...


### What's inside each folder:
- **1 Object Class** 📝 (data or transaction object)  
- **2 Components** ⚙️ (driver, monitor, or agents)  
- **1 Environment** 🌐 (connects components)  
- **1 Test Class** 🧪 (configures and runs the environment)  

### Variations across practices:
- `get/put` TLM connections 🔄  
- `blocking` vs `non-blocking` operations ⏱️  
- `analysis ports` and subscribers 📊  
- Other UVM communication or verification mechanisms 🧩  

## 🎯 Purpose

- Hands-on understanding of different **UVM concepts**  
- Show how the **same base components** can be reused with different communication techniques  
- Build a small library of practice testbenches for **real-world UVM usage**
