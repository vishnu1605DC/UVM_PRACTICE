# 🧠 UVM Practice Testbenches Repository

Welcome to my **UVM Practice Lab** 🚀 — a curated collection of **SystemVerilog + UVM testbenches** built to **understand core UVM concepts through hands-on coding** rather than just theory.

## 📚 What You’ll Find Here

* ✅ Clean and modular **UVM testbench structures**
* 🧱 Practical implementations of various **UVM concepts** that will be gradually added and explored in this repository.

## 💡 Why This Repository

This repo isn’t just a code dump — it’s designed to help:

* 🎯 **Beginners** get a clear, structured approach to learning UVM.
* 🧰 **Intermediate learners** practice advanced concepts like overrides, reporting, and TLM ports.
* 🧠 Build intuition through **short, focused testbenches** that can be extended.

## 🧭 Goals

* 📌 Strengthen my understanding of **UVM methodology**.
* 🧠 Build reusable TB structures.
* 🧪 Experiment with different UVM features.
* 🤝 Help others learn through practical, simple-to-follow examples.

## 🌟 Future Additions

* Scoreboard examples 🧮
* Coverage integration 🧪
* Interface-based TBs 🔌
* RISC-V DUT verification setup 🧠

## 🤝 Contributions

This is a **personal learning repo**, but suggestions and contributions are always welcome!
